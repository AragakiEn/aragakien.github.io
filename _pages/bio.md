I am a PhD student in Finance at Fox School of Business, Temple University. 

**Research interests: Asset Pricing, Derivatives, Commodities, International Finance, Machine Learning, FinTech.** My current research 
focuses on studying (i) the economic insights provided by traded derivatives in commodities and international markets; (ii) the linkage between theoretical
economic shocks and stock characteristics; and (iii) the application of machine learning and AI technologies to
address fundamental finance questions.

<!-- My resume can be found \[[here](../files/YuanHu_Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}\]. -->

<!-- I am skilled in 
**Econometrics**, 
**Asset Pricing**, 
**Mathematical Finance**,
**Predictive Analytics**,
**Causal Inference**, 
and 
**Machine Learning**,
supported by solid doctoral training and 5 years of research experience. In addition, I am proficient in large data analysis with the Python ecosystem.
Some specific areas of my research include investigating
(i) the additional insights provided by traded derivatives in commodities and international markets;
(ii) the risks associated with various characteristic-based factors across a wide range of assets; 
and 
(iii) the application of asset pricing methods in scenarios where the dataset is complex and contains a large number of variables. 
Overall, as Finance is about resolving uncertainties through scientific tools and data, my background naturally aligns with the goals of improving decision-making and evaluating policy impacts.

I am currently on the job market, actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute through my quantitative skills and real-life research experience. -->
