        <summary>Abstract</summary>
 Characteristics-based portfolios are puzzling to structural models in economics. I aggregate shocks from individual theories to study the linkage between stock characteristics and macroeconomic fundamentals. A novel methodology is proposed to construct more than 30 theory-motivated fundamental shocks using Meta's Llama3. Each fundamental is formed through Llama3's intelligent evaluation of economic activities discussed in newspapers, from the perspective of economic theories. These fundamentals include consumption, housing, human capital, and climate change, some of which are difficult to measure using standard economic variables. Main findings include (i) both aggregation and AI-based methodology incrementally contribute to explaining the cross-section of characteristics-sorted portfolios, (ii) that explanatory power is still insufficient to summarize cross-sectional variations of expected returns in the factor zoo, and (iii) aggregating AI-generated fundamental shocks delivers a mimicking portfolio with an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of 1.2, unexplained by common characteristics-based factor models. My results suggest that most theory-proposed fundamental risks and systematic risks that are potentially associated with stock characteristics do not overlap, but may complement each other. My analysis also illustrates a framework to leverage both AI technology and economic theories to interpret asset prices.

        <summary>Abstract</summary>
        We propose a model of options and futures on the dollar index, which are traded vehicles to protect against concerted U.S. dollar appreciations or depreciations. Estimating the model, we draw quantitative assessments and examine consistency with new empirical findings. First, average excess returns for out-of-the money (OTM) calls on dollar index futures are negative and statistically significant, whereas those for OTM puts are insignificant. Second, conveying strike-price-dependent dollar concerns, average excess returns for call options become more negative at higher strikes. The estimated model adheres to the data on option prices, volatilities, and supports negative risk premiums for OTM call options.

        <summary>Abstract</summary>
        This study investigates the market for crude oil options and identifies one key characteristic: significantly negative average excess returns for out-of-the-money call options expiring weekly and monthly, while put options show insignificant average excess returns. To explain the finding of upside risk premiums, we present a model that incorporates idiosyncratic, jump, unspanned, and spanned risks. This model allows us to calculate option prices and option risk premiums, which align with observed patterns in market behaviors, including option prices, option excess returns, Oil VIX levels, and actual volatility of oil futures.

        I show a nonlinear aggregation method that improves the asset pricing performance of nontradable fundamental risk factors on characteristics-based portfolio returns. The nonlinear aggregation transforms data into a higher-dimensional feature space, where standard principal component analysis can be applied without explicitly performing eigendecomposition. This approach helps to identify nonlinear fundamental factors that are potentially priced in the cross-section of characteristics-sorted portfolios.

        I incorporate a machine learning framework into vector autoregression (VAR) to implement the Campbell-Shiller decomposition. I show that incorporating machine learning significantly improves the reliability of the VAR-based results.
